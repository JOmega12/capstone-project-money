To see what dependencies you have instaleld without requirements you have installed:

- First activate your virtual env
- then `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- then write it down in your requirements.txt 

- in another computer that you are working from:
- ` pip install -r requirements.txt`


To get into virtual environment:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

.\.venv\Scripts\activate


To start project:
`django-admin startproject testAdmin .` 

In order to have a better, clean reusable code, it is better to have separate apps within a project.
Meaning, each app is an endpoint itself that connects to one another where the main controller (startproject) is the one that controls the urls


After creating the app, register to admin of your Models from models.py

Then in the URL

views in app folder is how you query the data(much like PRISMA ORM)

- When creating user models, AbstractBaseUser creates a very flexible way for the end user. You can basically customize the way logins/signups are compared to:
- the AbstractUser which uses Django's own model with slight tweaks here and there
