BACKEND: 
- create the backend for python for the three endpoints: 
    - user, expense, income
- customize user to be username, and password
    -create a jwt authentication for password


FRONTEND:
- refer to the github configuration to the coffee express for structure***
- create the structure for the landing page, login/sign up and the dashboard


Need to:
refactor the IncomeProvider so that it takes the total transaction and be able to update the state of the object when accessed later and when relogged in, the total still stays the same

Backend todo:
- connect the backend to frontend using CORS
    - fetch the data from the frontend side
    - make a separate compzonent to test if the code is receiving data from the backend


    
Currently struggling with connecting the backend to front end.
I created a fetch on WelcomeComponent and then i am testing the transactions/ endpoint to see if the data will fetch. 

Will need to put in the headers for the token to see if it goes through

I also have a feeling I need to reconfigure my settings.py for allowed sites as well as maybe creating a dummy test endpoint data from django to be relayed to the front end to see if the data is parsing through
